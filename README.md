# RestartApp
Sometimes we feel discouraged. Sometimes we are vastly disappointed too. If so, by practicing solitude we can feel better and focused. This is when we create amazing things. Please join me to develop this beautiful iOS application with SwiftUI.


ADVANCED APP DESIGN
The main goal of this mini project is to inspire you on what we can accomplish with the SwiftUI framework.

COMPLEX SWIFTUI GESTURES
We will create such a custom button with complex gestures that we can not find in Appleâ€™s stock user interface library.

PARALLAX EFFECT
By using multiple movements in the opposite direction (parallax effect) we can add depth to this amazing onboarding screen.
